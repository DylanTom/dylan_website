    "reflection": "This was a very quick two week project I had over the summer of 2021. There were not many challenges with this but it was challenging for me to understand CSS flexboxes. I'm not a very good designer so I don't know what colors match and what features should go in certain positions. For example, the gray background does not seem to complement the black text.",
