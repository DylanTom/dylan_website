    "summary": "Created an \"Space Invaders\"-like game in Python for an introductory computer science course.",
    "reflection": "This project was a cumulative assignment for my intro CS class at Cornell which involved me implementing classes into a code skeleton. I had to use classes, define functions, write specifications, and understand APIs. Python structures that were utilized included: nested loops, coroutines, animation frames, and collisions. I gained experience in GUI applications and documenting my code. This allowed me to keep track of bugs and errors that arose during the development process.",
