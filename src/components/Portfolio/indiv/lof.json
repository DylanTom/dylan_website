    "reflection": "There are a lot of lessons learned when I completed this research project. The most important one that still sticks with me is to properly store files and have a good organization system. If you happen to take a peek at the repository there doesn't appear to be any order or system to keep the files. From this project I learned to label files with data, scripts, or figures and to have a file management system in place before making files. In addition, I created simple data visualizations using matplotlib.pyplot and created scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts. Creating multiple functions was hard and I ended up creating a bunch of redundant files which cluttered the project even more. When there is a function I might use but it is a draft, I should keep a document but only have one version up and running at a time. This was a hard research problem in which I felt I did not conclude as much as I wanted to but it was a very good experience.",
