    "reflection": "In this project, I wanted to apply my knowledge from my introductory CS class and create an applied application. This text based sudoku solver uses object oriented programming in order to add more games in the future. I create a class for each game and in `__main__.py`, I use a UX to ask the user which game they want to play. The main functions were relatively simple as the rules are well defined. Rather, the main bugs appeared when I tried to cross check the integers and the input (as they are strings), which is why a designer and implementer should be two different people in order to avoid this error.",
