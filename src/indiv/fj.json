    "summary": "One of the challenges that Farmworker Justice faces is tracking farmworker data and analyzing trends over time. The NPO wants to generate visualizations and reports that can be shared. At Cornell, I joined this team to help Hack4Impact create an interactive visualization dashboard that centralizes farmworker data information from public sources.",
    "reflection": "I enjoyed the ability to learn Git and gain practical experience regarding industry practices. However, a challenge I had was working with an existing codebase. I had to learn the tech stack, which I was unfamiliar with, and understand existing documentation (or lack thereof) of existing functions and methods. One mistake I made was not being very communicative and thinking I could do everything on my own at first. Sure, all the tasks were relatively straightforward, but the learning experience I was supposed to take away was working in a small team of developers creating a unified product. It was ifficult to work in pairs as it was hard to find time between the two of us, so in the future I would schedule blocks of 2-3 hrs/wk to work with my partner outside of the collaborative meeting time",
