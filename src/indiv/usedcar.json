    "reflection": "This was the first project I worked in a small group of three for my information science class at Cornell University. We had to find an open source dataset which might not have been clean. There was a lot of noise we had to filter and we had to encode several categorical variables in order to perform numerical analysis. I gained experience using Github as a collaboration platform and used Jupyter notebook to document a \"storytelling\" of the dataset. Using knowledge from class lectures, we implemented different data visualizations and supervised machine learning algorithms.",
